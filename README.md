## Getting Started

To get started with this Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/[project-name].git
   cd [project-name]
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the project**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

- `lib/`: Contains the main source code for the Flutter application.
- `application/`: Contains environment variables and assets.
- `pubspec.yaml`: The Flutter package manager configuration file.

## Architecture

This project follows a clean architecture approach, promoting separation of concerns and making the codebase easier to maintain. The core structure includes:

- **Core**: Contains essential services, utilities, and models.
- **Features**: Specific implementations of features (not shown in the current script but recommended for scalability).
- **Widgets**: Custom widgets used throughout the app.

## Code Snippets

### Main Application Entry

The main entry point of the application is located in `lib/main.dart`:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await dotenv.load(fileName: 'application/.env');
  await di.init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Dependency Injection Setup

In `lib/core/services/injection_container.dart`:

```dart
final sl = GetIt.instance;

Future<void> init() async {
  sl.registerLazySingleton(() => LocalNotificationService());
  // Additional services...
}
```
